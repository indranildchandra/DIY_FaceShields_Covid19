## BoM ##

1. SHIELD and HEAD BAND : We're using OHP Film, size A3, thickness 175 microns. This is what we have easily available locally.
2. RETENTION : Elastic Band or similar for retention, approx. 200 mm / 8 inches long
3. OPTIONAL : Foam strip, adhesive. To be stuck on the inside surface that touches forehead, for long duration comfort (not essential)


## ASSEMBLY ##

1. Laser Cut the A3 OHP sheet. We added an extra head band strip in case the original is lost or tears.
2. Soak in Soap water for 30 minutes, and then in clean water for 30 minutes.
3. Air dry in the Sun.
4. Attach the head band, face shield and elastic retention band in a single step.
5. Apply foam along the area which comes in contact with the forehead. We have not used any, and this is optional. It improves comfort over extended hours of use, but can be skipped, especially if the shield is already worn over other gear such as caps.
